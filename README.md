The Gaming Room is a a client who wants to set up a web based version of a gaming app in this desing document.
The Gaming Room Wants help designing a game called Draw it or Lose it.
In Draw it or lose it drawings are rendered steadily for 30 seconds.
If the team does not guess the drawing in 30 seconds the opposing team gets 15 seconds to guess once.
This document has strong documentations and analyzation of different operating platforms.
This document made me think of different technical and desing constraints while developing code.
If I was going to revise a part of this document it would be the executive summary.
In revising the executive summary I would fiund a more plain yet concise way to inform executives of the details of the project.
In the design constraints I laid out some of the hurdles and needs of The Gaming Room.
I also tailored the analyzation of the different opertaing platforms to the needs of The Gaming Room.
It is important to recognize these needs to provide the most value to the customer.
In designing the software I tried to make incremental functional code.
In the future I would make efforts to increase the functionality of the software when communicating with web services using JaxRS.
